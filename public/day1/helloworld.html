		<p>I learned about this idea of doing 180 websites in 180 days from a coworker and I thought umm well I will give this a shot to help build up my skills and just have some fun with it. When I decided to sit down and actually try this I had heard about Web Speech API having speech synthesis.  I learned this from <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk---Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API">http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk---Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API</a>. So here it goes... :) What the voice is saying (Try Safari for full effect): Facebook news feeds are full of garbage.</p>
