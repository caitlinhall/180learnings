<h1>HTML5 Bouncing Balls</h1>
<div id="text">
  <p>This is HTML5 Canvas. I still have a lot to learn about this, but for a quick demo and learning about it here is what I did. I found this demo <a href="http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-google-bouncing-balls/">here</a> and implemented it in my own way. You can push the balls around only in desktop. Also learned about 2d canvas context (creates curvy lines). Example <a href="http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/tutorials/html5-canvas-paths/">here</a>. </p>
